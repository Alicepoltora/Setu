// PR-5 regression: round-aware ConsensusFrame + soft drift outcomes.
//
// These tests live as a crate-level integration test (separate from the
// engine.rs unit tests) so that they exercise only the **public** consensus
// API surface — `ConsensusEngine::new`, `receive_cf`, `advance_round`,
// `current_round`, plus the re-exported `CfReceiveOutcome` and
// `ConsensusFrame`. Anything that compiles against this file is also
// available to downstream crates (setu-validator, setu-solver).
//
// Scope (per docs/feat/post-restart-finality-stall-v3/design.md PR-5):
//   - cf.round is bound into the CF id (verify_id catches tamper)
//   - is_valid_proposer is evaluated against cf.round, not local round
//   - cf.round > local_round → NeedsCatchUp with up_to_depth = depth-1
//   - cf.round < local_round → Stale outcome, never InvalidData
//   - cf.round == local_round on the happy path → Accepted
